# Changelog

This document contains the consolidated implementation history and technical decisions for the Antunello App.

## Performance Optimizations

### Transaction Data Management
- Implemented optimized transaction hooks with intelligent caching
- Added SWR-based data fetching with deduplication and background updates
- Introduced real-time subscriptions with optimistic updates
- Cache management with persistence and automatic clearing on sign out

### Navigation Performance  
- Eliminated 500ms RSC (React Server Components) requests by using client-side state management
- Replaced route-based navigation (`/protected/2024/12`) with query parameters (`/protected?year=2024&month=12`)
- Implemented `window.history.pushState()` for instant navigation without server round-trips
- Added aggressive prefetching for adjacent months data

### UI/UX Enhancements
- Loading performance optimization by importing critical components directly
- Implemented slide animations for month navigation with loading states
- Added sticky header positioning with enhanced month container overflow handling
- Modern UI redesign with improved responsiveness

## Modal System Implementation

### Transaction Form Modals
- Consolidated multiple transaction form variants into single optimized component
- HTML-based design implementation for better performance
- Modern styling with improved user experience
- Form validation and error handling enhancements

### Modal Fixes and Improvements
- Fixed modal backdrop and focus management
- Improved accessibility with proper ARIA attributes  
- Enhanced mobile responsiveness
- Optimized modal rendering performance

## Architecture Decisions

### Code Organization
- Streamlined component structure with removal of duplicate files
- Consolidated utility functions into single `lib/utils.ts` file
- Removed redundant hooks and components (transaction-form variants, table variants)
- Cleaned up unused page components and modern variants

### State Management
- SWR for client-side data fetching and caching
- Real-time subscriptions with Supabase
- Optimistic updates for better perceived performance
- Client-side state for navigation to avoid server requests

## Technical Implementations

### Animation System
- Reverse animation implementation for smooth transitions
- Slide animations with proper cleanup and state management
- Loading states during navigation transitions
- Direction-aware slide effects (left/right based on navigation)

### Database Integration
- Optimized Supabase queries with proper filtering and sorting
- Transaction categorization with main and sub-categories
- User-specific data isolation and security
- Real-time updates with conflict resolution

## Removed/Deprecated Features

### Cleaned Up Files
- `GEMINI.md` - Removed AI-specific documentation
- `transaction-form.tsx`, `transaction-form-modern.tsx`, `transaction-form-optimized.tsx` - Consolidated into single component
- `transactions-table.tsx` - Replaced with optimized version
- `useTransactions.ts` - Replaced with optimized hook
- `utils/utils.ts` - Consolidated into `lib/utils.ts`
- Various page-modern.tsx variants - Removed unused route variants

### Performance Debt Removed
- Eliminated multiple RSC requests that caused 500ms delays
- Removed redundant prefetching logic
- Cleaned up unnecessary route processing
- Streamlined animation state management

## Current Architecture

The app now uses:
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with App Router, optimized client-side navigation
- **Database**: Supabase with real-time subscriptions
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **State**: SWR for data, React state for UI interactions
- **Performance**: Aggressive caching, prefetching, and optimistic updates
